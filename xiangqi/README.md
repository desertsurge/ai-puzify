# Chinese Chess (Xiangqi)

Welcome to Chinese Chess (Xiangqi)! This is a digital implementation of the traditional Chinese board game, similar to Western chess but with unique rules and pieces.

## Game Overview

Chinese Chess is played on a 9×10 rectangular grid with a "river" dividing the board horizontally. Each player commands an army of seven different types of pieces, with the objective of capturing the enemy's general (king).

## How to Play

1. **Objective**: Capture the opponent's general (king).
2. **Players**: Red goes first, then players alternate turns.
3. **Pieces**:
   - **General (King)**: Moves exactly one point orthogonally and must remain within the palace.
   - **Advisor**: Moves exactly one point diagonally and must remain within the palace.
   - **Elephant**: Moves exactly two points diagonally and cannot cross the river.
   - **Horse**: Moves one point orthogonally followed by one point diagonally, with the caveat that it cannot be blocked.
   - **Chariot (Rook)**: Moves any distance orthogonally (like the rook in Western chess).
   - **Cannon**: Moves like a chariot but must "jump" over exactly one piece when capturing.
   - **Soldier (Pawn)**: Moves forward before crossing the river, then forward or sideways after crossing.
